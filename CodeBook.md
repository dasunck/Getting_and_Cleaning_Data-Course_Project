Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

Identifiers : 

subject - Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

activity - Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values:

	WALKING: subject was walking

Average of measurements

- Measurements are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Prior to normalisation, The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- Prior to normalisation, The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

Transformations:

The source data is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

run_analysis.R R script performs following transformations to the source data:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Also Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
