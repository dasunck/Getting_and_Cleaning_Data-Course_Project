Files : 

CodeBook.md:
Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R:

Contains R source code which downloads the raw data and load data to R data-frames then performs the data preparation in 5 steps as described in the course project description.
	1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Tidy_Data.txt file is generated after performing first four steps of transformations.
Grouped_Tidy_Data.txt is generated after performing all five steps of transformations.
